This is a simil Doodle jump game. Enjoy.

The base game was created by KidsCanCode  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNaPQ5uLX5iIEHUCLmfAgKg

Things I added:
 - Better platform generation.
 - Mobs won't hit you if they are not in the screen (Or at least they shoudn't).
 - New powerups.
 - Changed the color of the powerups for better visibility.
 - Small changes in settings in general.
 - Different sound effects.
